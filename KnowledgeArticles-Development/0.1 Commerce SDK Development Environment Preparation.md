## How to Set Up a Commerce SDK Development Environment for Store Commerce

### 1. Background

- Developers need to prepare a Commerce SDK development environment before starting extension development work such as coding, deploying, and debugging.
- This document contains the basic steps of Commerce SDK development environment preparation. Some corner scenarios like network/certificate/TLS may require opening support tickets for troubleshooting, so we cannot cover all the details. However, following this document should enable most developers to set up a Commerce SDK environment.
- The basic steps include:
    + System preparation
    + Sealed CSU and Store Commerce Installation
    + Software Installation
    + Github Repository clone
    + Building Samples to get extension installer
    + Deploying installer
    + Verifying the extension function and debugging for troubleshooting

### 2. Steps to Set Up a Commerce SDK Development Environment

#### 2.1. System preparation

- For detailed and useful information, refer to [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit/tree/release/9.45/src/ScaleUnitSample#shared-across-self-hosted-and-iis-hosted-modes).
- Some preferences:
    + Prefer Visual Studio 2022 instead of Visual Studio Code
    + Install .NET Framework 4.7.2 to support Store Commerce Extension Installer and Scale Unit Extension Installer
    + Install .NET 6.0 instead of .NET 3.1: [Download Link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
    + Install Hosting Bundle from the same page

#### 2.2. Install Sealed Version CSU:

- Follow [this link](https://github.com/zhangguanghuib/NewCommerceSDK/blob/main/Readme_Docs/IIS-Hosted-CSU-SingleApp.md) which has been verified to work for many people.
- Official documents:
    + [Introducing Sealed Installers](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/?redirectedFrom=https://community.dynamics.com/ax/b/axforretail/posts/introducing-sealed-installers)
    + [Install CSU Development Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/install-csu-dev-env)

#### 2.3. Install Store Commerce Application

- Install Microsoft Edge WebView2 from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH).
- Download Store Commerce Installer and run the following command to install it:
    + For CPOS:
        ```
        StoreCommerce.Installer.exe install --enablewebviewdevtools --trustsqlservercertificate --installoffline --SqlServerName .\sqlexpress
        ```
        (or for CPOS) `StoreCommerce.Installer.exe install --enablewebviewdevtools --useremoteappcontent`
- Useful commands can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/enhanced-mass-deployment).
- At this point, the development environment should be ready for your development work.

### 3. Start your development work:

#### 3.1. Clone GitHub Repositories

- Clone the following repositories for a good starting point:
    + [Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.ScaleUnit)
    + [Dynamics365Commerce.InStore](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.InStore)
- If you have never used the tool git, please download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and then run the following commands:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.InStore.git
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365Commerce.InStore.git
    git checkout release/9.49
    ```
#### 3.2. Open Visual Studio Solution, make sure the solution contains these project

- The project structure should looks like:<br/>

  If any project are missing, you can just copy it from other solutions
