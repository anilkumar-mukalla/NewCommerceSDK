### Solution
Those instrument keys are used for Telemetry only, hence you can copy the Instrument key from other environment as a workaround (I don't have permenant solutions for this environment issue)<br/>

## Issue 3: Install Commerce SDK CSU Extension, failed the below error <mark>This installer depends on a Sealed 'Commerce Scale Unit' (command line rather than UI based) which is not installed. Install it first and try again.</mark>:<br/>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2929bab3-dd24-4ddf-a56d-2ffc84935a88)
### Root cause
From the above screen-shot, we can see the installer is trying to install the CSU extension to the <mark>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics 365\Commerce Scale Unit\Extensions"</mark>, this is wrong because the correct path is: <mark>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365\Commerce Scale Unit\Extensions</mark>, this issue is typically caused by the CSU extension installer is build under .Net Framework 4.6.1.

### Resolution:
Update the CSU Installer project target framework to .Net Framework 472:<br/>

### Root cause
When check the event viewer logs, we can see this errors:<br/>
```

### Resolution:
This issue is typically caused by the "Async Client Id" is not registered in the D365 FO "Microsoft Entra ID applications" form:<br/>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b4f8da-c587-4e2c-af59-5e65bf0cf114)<br/>
After register the "Async Client App Id", the download session can be applied.

## Issue 5: When activated POS, faced this error:<br/>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dae3629-d088-432f-bb0e-eea7ebdb7745)<br/>
```
There is no data to initialize the extensible enumeration type. The enumeration type name: Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.DataModel.ExtensibleRetailChannelType. Run Initialize in Retail headquarters Commerce parameters and run the CDX job 1110 .
```
### Root cause:
Run the below two SQL queries in Channel DB and in AXDB and make sure there are results returned:<br/>
```sql
select * from ax.retailenumvaluetable where enumname =  'RetailChannelType' 
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a5cc1e-4d27-491f-8513-066008a9fef6)<br/>

and in HQ DB:<br/>
```
select * from dbo.enumvaluetable where enumid in (select id from dbo.ENUMIDTABLE where name = 'RetailChannelType')
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c86edbbf-b803-421d-971e-88e9c7745ec2)<br/>
