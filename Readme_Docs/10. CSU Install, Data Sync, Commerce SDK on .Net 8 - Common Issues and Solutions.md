### Root cause
From the above screen-shot, we can see the installer is trying to install the CSU extension to the <mark>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics 365\Commerce Scale Unit\Extensions"</mark>, this is wrong because the correct path is: <mark>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365\Commerce Scale Unit\Extensions</mark>, this issue is typically caused by the CSU extension installer is build under .Net Framework 4.6.1.

### Resolution:
Update the CSU Installer project target framework to .Net Framework 472:<br/>
