3. When attach the process: <br/>
    <mark>Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.StoreCommerce.exe</mark><br/>
    In this scenario,  seems the hardware station module seems cannot be loaded because the breakpoints are showing “Hollow Red Dot” instead only offline Commerce Runtime Modules are loaded:<br/>
