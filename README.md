## New Commerce SDK benifit
   1.   Don't need LCS VM  + Retail SDK,  normal DEV Box(Visual stuido 2017(2019)/Visual Studio code + .Net Core/.Net Frameork) is OK  to develop commerce extension (POS, CRTï¼ŒRetail Server).
   2.   Any changes in custom logic,  you can nonly build the corresponding extension installer, un-install and re-install the extension installer, not need build the whole retail SDK  and create a Deployable package.   MPOS->MPOS Installer,   RSSU ->RSSU Installer
   3.   The process is simplified.
          Before we need create retail proxy project,  and copy the generated TypeScript Proxy and copy to POS project.
          Now we have one single C# project for CRT and retail server, and add this project as reference to POS  project, the TS  proxy will be generated automatically when build the solution
         
         Before we need manually update commerceruntime.ext.config and web.config to add the extension assembly
         Now we don't need do that.

    Before doing the below steps, you can refer to this link to understand how we can make store hours sample work on old retail SDK: https://github.com/zhangguanghuib/POS_Extension/tree/main/StoreHours
    1. Create a repo in you github
    2. Create a solution
    3. Add these C# projects, 
        These projects with Target Framework .NET Standard 2.0, Output Type Class Libarary
            ChannelDatabase
            CommerceRuntime
            POS                   with reference CommerceRuntime
            ScaleUnit             with reference POS, ChannelDatabase and CommerceRuntime.
        These projects with Target Framework .Net Framework 4.6.1, Output Type is Console Application, that is exe
            StoreCommerceApp.Installer:  with reference POS, ChannelDatabase and CommerceRuntime
            ScaleUnit.Installer
