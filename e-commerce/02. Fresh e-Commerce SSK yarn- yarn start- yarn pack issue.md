# D365 E-Commerce SSK 10.0.42 (Commerce Component Version 9.52) build error

Basically we when follow this document (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/e-commerce-extensibility/setup-dev-environment) to buils a local e-Commerce development environment, we will face these issues:<br/>
##1. Issue #1:<br/>
   This issue is described in:<br/>
   https://github.com/microsoft/Msdyn365.Commerce.Online/issues/76<br/>
   The main error is when run yarn to install dependencies, we will see this error:
   ```
   error lru-cache@11.0.2: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "20 || >=22". Got "18.x.x" error Found incompatible module.
   ```
   Basically some one will think we need upgrade the Node version to version 20 even version 22, actually we still need node version is version 16:<br/>
