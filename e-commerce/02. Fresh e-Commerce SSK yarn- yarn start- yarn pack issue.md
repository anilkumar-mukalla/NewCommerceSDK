# D365 E-Commerce SSK 10.0.42 (Commerce Component Version 9.52) build error

Basically we when follow this document (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/e-commerce-extensibility/setup-dev-environment) to buils a local e-Commerce development environment, we will face these issues:<br/>
##1. Issue #1:<br/>
   This issue is described in:<br/>
   https://github.com/microsoft/Msdyn365.Commerce.Online/issues/76<br/>
   The main error is when run yarn to install dependencies, we will see this error:
   ```
   error lru-cache@11.0.2: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "20 || >=22". Got "18.x.x" error Found incompatible module.
   ```
   Basically some one will think we need upgrade the Node version to version 20 even version 22, actually we still need node version is version 16:<br/>

### Root cause

When run "yarn msdyn365 pack", there is an embeded sever that will be running on the port 8080, if the port 8080 on your computer has been occupied, it will fail finally.

### How to identify if there is a 8080 running in your computer?
 Run this command:
 ```
 netstat -an | findstr "LISTENING"

 ```
Then you will got these result:<br/>
