#Conclusion

It will be interesting to see how this project evolves. Potential applications could include many cases, e.g., creating alternatives to the ER framework for simple reporting solutions.
Of course, the most profitable option for the X++ community would be for Microsoft to add this to the base product. But even in its current state, the project is amazing.
Author Milnet92(https://www.linkedin.com/in/oriol-ribes-amen%C3%B3s-16055667/) did a huge job, so give him a star on GitHub(https://github.com/milnet92/MXTXppInterpreter).
